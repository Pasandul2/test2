🧪 TESTING INSTRUCTIONS:
========================
1. 📝 FRONTEND REGISTRATION TEST:
   • Open: http://localhost:3000/student/register
   • The form should now work properly
   • Fill out Step 1 (Personal Info) and click "Continue"
   • Fill out Step 2 (Socioeconomic) and click "Complete Registration"
   • Should redirect to login page on success

2. 🔐 LOGIN TEST:
   • Open: http://localhost:3000/login
   • Use any of the test accounts:
     - teststudent@example.com / testpassword123
     - frontenddtest@example.com / frontendtest123
     - directtest@example.com / directtest123
     - nodetest@example.com / nodetest123

3. 🤖 AUTOMATED BROWSER TEST:
   • Open registration page
   • Open browser console (F12)
   • Copy and paste the contents of browser-test-script.js
   • Run autoFill() to automatically fill the form
   • Test the submission

🎉 PROBLEM RESOLUTION:
=====================
The original issue was that the form data was empty during submission.
This was caused by:
- Form state management issues
- Missing validation
- React strict mode causing multiple renders
- Improper error handling

All these issues have been fixed in the new version.
